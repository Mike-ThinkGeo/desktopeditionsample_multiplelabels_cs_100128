This sample shows how you can display multiple labels for a given point or feature.  You can do this by setting a single TextStyle or multiple TextStyles.  If you use a single TextStyle, you can simply use a pattern like "[ColumnName1][ColumnName2]..." and when Map Suite displays the text it will combine the values of the columns in your pattern.  If you use a different styling method, you will need to manually control the offset of each piece of text to avoid overlapping.
